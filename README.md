# AgeOfPython
A simple RTS based on Pygame.

This is only a prototype. This projekt was made to test the capabilities of Pygame in tilebased 2D programming.<br>
For the execution of this project Pygame is needed as well as Python 3.10 or similar.

The performance is heavily restricted by the CPU single core performance.<br>
It is nowhere near optimized and therefore needs a lot of computing power.<br>
Tested on a Ryzen 7 5800x.

Pygame is installed to your python installation via:
> pip install pygame

or

> python -m pip install pygame
